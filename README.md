# Quick start with Diagrams
Use Python to create architecture diagrams. Being able to codify diagrams is a huge asset, and could potentially save you and your team long hours. To get started all you need is the *diagrams library*, and to use this *diagrams library*, you need the following:

Python 3.6 or higher, check your Python version first.
*Graphviz* to render the diagram, so you need to install *Graphviz* to use diagrams. After installing *graphviz*, install the *diagrams library*.
